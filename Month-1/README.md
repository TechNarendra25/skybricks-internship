PART 1: MONTH 1 – PYTHON BASICS AND DATA MANIPULATION

Objectives:
• Learn Python programming basics.
• Practice data manipulation with basic Python, NumPy, and Pandas.
• Implement basic Python scripts for data processing and visualization.

Tasks to Complete:
1. Week 1: Introduction to Python Programming
o Theory: Study Python variables, data types, operators, input/output,
conditional statements (if-else), loops (for, while).
o Hands-On: Write basic Python programs (e.g., temperature converter,
calculator).
o Client Project: Create a basic data processing script (e.g., calculating the
average temperature).
o Submit: Python script and a summary of the concepts learned (on Google
Classroom).

2. Week 2: Data Structures and Functions
o Theory: Study Python lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, functions, lambda
functions, recursion, and list comprehension.
o Hands-On: Work with data structures and write functions for data
transformations (e.g., sum of squares, filtering).
o Client Project: Write a script for data cleaning (e.g., remove duplicates, filter
data).
o Submit: Python script and a summary of the concepts learned (on Google
Classroom).

3. Week 3: NumPy and Pandas for Data Manipulation
o Theory: Study NumPy arrays, operations, broadcasting, and Pandas
DataFrames, Series, indexing, and data grouping.
o Hands-On: Perform operations with NumPy and manipulate datasets with
Pandas.
o Client Project: Clean and aggregate a dataset (e.g., remove missing values,
calculate averages).
o Submit: Python script and a summary of the concepts learned (on Google
Classroom).

4. Week 4: Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
o Theory: Learn about Matplotlib (basic plots) and Seaborn (advanced plots like
heatmaps, pairplots).
o Hands-On: Create visualizations for dataset analysis.
o Client Project: Create a dashboard for visualizing relationships between
features in a dataset (e.g., scatter plots, histograms).
o Submit: Python script, plots, and a summary of the concepts learned (on
Google Classroom).
